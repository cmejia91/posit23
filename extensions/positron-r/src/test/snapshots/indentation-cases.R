# The cursor position is represented by a string containing angular brackets. A
# newline is typed at that position, triggering indentation rules. The result is
# saved in the snapshot file.

# Snippets are separated by `# ---`. This makes it possible to extract them and
# process them separately to prevent interferences between test cases.
