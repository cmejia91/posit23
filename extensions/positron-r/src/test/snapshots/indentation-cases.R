# Indentation snapshots. Edit cases in `indentation-cases.R` and observe results
# in `indentation-snapshots.R`.
#
# The cursor position is represented by a string containing angular brackets. A
# newline is typed at that position, triggering indentation rules. The result is
# saved in the snapshot file.
#
# Snippets are separated by `# ---`. This makes it possible to extract them and
# process them separately to prevent interferences between test cases.
