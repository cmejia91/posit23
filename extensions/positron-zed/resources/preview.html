		<h1>Falling Stars</h1>
		<p>
			Do you remember still the falling stars<br />
			that like swift horses through the heavens raced<br />
			and suddenly leaped across the hurdles<br />
			of our wishes--do you recall? And we<br />
			did make so many! For there were countless numbers of stars:<br />
			each time we looked above we were<br />
			astounded by the swiftness of their daring play,<br />
			while in our hearts we felt safe and secure<br />
			watching these brilliant bodies disintegrate,<br />
			knowing somehow we had survived their fall.<br />
