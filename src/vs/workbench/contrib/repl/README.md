## Repl

This folder contains the sources for the REPL pane. This contribution to the workbench will have the following features:

- Similar behavior and UI to the Myriac Console prototype
- Similar workspace integration to the Terminal pane, including Panel and Editor Group integration
- Similar functionality to the Jupyter plugin's Interactive Window
- Uses a `NotebookController` to execute code; free of dependencies on specific notebook executors
